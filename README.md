# DODO~VIRUS

![Virus Preview](https://i.ibb.co/QkBqtSC/D51-B5-ECC-D63-E-43-C1-925-A-1-D380-E380584.png)

This project contains C# code that implements various bizarre effects on the system, inspired by a virus called **DOMO**, created by an individual named **ABOLHB**. The `MasonClass` code is designed to demonstrate specific functionalities that include manipulating system resources in a way that simulates various disruptive behaviors. The key features of this code include:

## Code Description

### Key Functionalities

1. **Writing to the MBR**:
   - The code includes a method that modifies the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the primary hard drive. Writing to the MBR can disrupt the boot process of a system, which can lead to data loss or inaccessibility.
   - The function generates random bytes and writes them to the MBR, essentially overwriting critical boot information. This is done through direct file access to the physical drive.

2. **Creating Screen Effects**:
   - The code employs GDI (Graphics Device Interface) functions to create visual disturbances on the screen. It achieves this by continuously drawing random areas of the screen with varying opacities, creating a flickering effect that can be quite disorienting.
   - A dedicated thread is started to handle these visual effects, allowing the main application to run concurrently without freezing the user interface.

3. **Random Mouse Movement**:
   - The code simulates mouse movement by changing the cursor's position to random coordinates on the screen. This is accomplished by invoking Windows API calls that manipulate the cursor's location.
   - Another thread manages this functionality, causing the mouse to move unpredictably, which can be frustrating for users attempting to interact with their system.

### Usage Instructions

- This code should be run on a Windows system with administrative privileges due to the nature of the operations performed, particularly writing to the MBR.
- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions and are aware of the risks involved in modifying system-level components.
